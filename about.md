### Status
I'm currently looking for a job in Software Developement, check my [resume](https://www.visualcv.com/salim-mahboubi/), and contact me at: [msalim@boun.cr](mailto:msalim@boun.cr) for more informations and private code portfolio.  
**Current location:** Oran, Algeria.  
**Accept remote/relocation:** Yes.  

### What I am learning now
Right now I'm focusing on front end developement, especially **React JS** and related techologies. I'm planning to learn **Elm-lang** after becoming really comfortable using React JS and co.  
From time to time, I play with **Android**, making side projects or mini apps; I also try playing around with **blockchain** and **hashgraph** related technologies.

### What I studied  
In June 2017, I finshed my Master's program in Computer Science specializing in Education Engineering, where I learned a lot about some advanced computer science concepts, and especially how to use technology to educate people with different backgrounds and different aptitudes. We used different tools, such as **Unity Game Engine** to make serious games, **JADE(JAVA Agent DEvelopment Framework)** to make simple multi-agent systems, and others. I finalized my degree with an end of studies project where my partner and I built a mobile tourism app to assist piligrims in Mecca, taking  in consideration their abilities and specifities.  
Before, I studied core concepts of computer science, from Algebra and algorithms to Graph Theory in my Licenciate program (equivalent to bachelor).

### Projects
